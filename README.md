Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking 
As a student exploring the world of cybersecurity, I quickly discovered that learning about
penetration testing and ethical hacking isn't just about reading theoryâ€”it's about thinking like an
attacker and solving problems hands-on. These fields focus on testing the security of systems
by simulating real cyberattacks, but with permission and the goal of helping organizations fix
their weaknesses before real threats exploit them.
